I'm a software engineering guy who works at Minimax Labs. Nothing I say represents the views of my employer, of course. 

I program and write about software development when I have the time. More information can be found through <a href="https://github.com/roberterdin">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberterdin/" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>
